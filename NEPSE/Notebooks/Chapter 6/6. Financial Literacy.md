## 🔄 Fund Transfer & Investment Cycle

- **When the emergency fund reaches Rs. 25,000**:  
  - Transfer **Rs. 20,000** to my **Garima Account** dedicated to investments.
- **Investment Strategy**:  
  - Use these funds to buy stocks monthly (a strategy similar to a SIP) since I cancelled my previous SIP.
- This cycle of saving and transferring continues, ensuring I always have a safety net while still growing my wealth.

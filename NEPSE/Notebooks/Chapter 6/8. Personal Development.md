### Daily Routine for Trading Discipline

**1. Morning Routine**  
- **Visualize Success:** Spend 2–3 minutes imagining yourself trading calmly and following your strategy.
- **Review Your Trading Plan:** Quickly go over your entry, exit, and risk management rules.
- **Set a Clear Goal:** Define one or two specific goals for the day (e.g., stick strictly to your stop-loss).

**2. During Trading**  
- **Follow Your Strategy:** Only take trades that meet your plan’s criteria—avoid impulsive decisions.
- **Use Risk Management:** Always set stop-loss orders and only risk a fixed percentage of your account.
- **Quick Check-Ins:** Pause mid-day to assess if you're following your plan. Adjust calmly if necessary.

**3. Handling Setbacks**  
- **Reflect on Each Trade:** After a trade, briefly note what went right or wrong.
- **Stay Calm:** When stress arises, take a few deep breaths or a short break to regain focus.

**4. End-of-Day Reflection**  
- **Review Trades:** Look over your trades and check if you followed your plan.

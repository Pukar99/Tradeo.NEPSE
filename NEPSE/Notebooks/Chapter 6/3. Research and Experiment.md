## Research and Experiment

### Topic: NEPSE Seasonal Pattern

#### Objectives
- To gain insight regarding seasonality in bull and bear phases in NEPSE by focusing not only on the entire dataset but also on the trending data from the last 5 years for the latest insight.

#### Data Sources and Data Collection
- **File Path:** `TRADEO/NEPSE/NepseOverviewData.xlsx`
- **Data Sources:** Manually collected from [nepsealpha.com/trading/chart](http://nepsealpha.com/trading/chart) in monthly views and recorded from 2002 to January 2025. However, for this study, we considered data from 2004 to January 2025.

#### How Bull and Bear Are Classified
**What are the main things that distinguish bull and bear?**  
**Ans:** When the yearly sum is positive, it is classified as bull, and when the yearly sum is negative, it is classified as bear.

### Bull Years

**Table 1: BULL YEARS Data**

| Period        | Duration   |
|---------------|------------|
| 2004-2007     | 4 Years    |
| 2012-2016     | 5 Years    |
| 2020-2021     | 2 Years    |
| 2024-ongoing  | N/A        |

From the above data in Table 1, the first two bull phases lasted more than 4 years, but why is the recent bull phase shorter? The possible reasons might be the strict rules of the NRB regarding monetary policies and, most importantly, the online TMS system (started on November 6, 2018), which provided on-hand access for everybody from anywhere. This change has led to an increase in traders and rapid rises and corrections.

### Bear Years

**Table 2: BEAR YEARS Data**

| Period        | Duration   |
|---------------|------------|
| 2008-2011     | 4 Years    |
| 2017-2019     | 3 Years    |
| 2022-2023     | 2 Years    |

From the above data in Table 2, we can see that the duration of bear phases has also decreased. This might be due to the influx of traders and young investors in the market, whereas earlier, the market was dominated by older age groups.

## ðŸ§  **Why Is Recovery Harder After Larger Drawdowns?**  

1. **Exponential Gains Required:**  
   - As the table shows, the percentage gain required to recover grows exponentially with the size of the drawdown.  
   - For example, a **50% loss** needs a **100% gain** to recover, while a **70% loss** needs a staggering **233% gain**.

2. **Capital at Risk:**  
   - With a smaller account balance, your position sizes become smaller, limiting your ability to generate larger returns.  

3. **Psychological Strain:**  
   - Large losses can lead to emotional trading, poor decision-making, and increased risk-taking, compounding the problem.

## ðŸ’¡ **Key Takeaway:**  

Minimizing drawdowns is critical for long-term success in trading.  
- **Small losses** are easier to recover from and allow you to maintain confidence and discipline.  
- Use proper **risk management** to avoid large drawdowns, such as risking only **1-2% of your capital** per trade.  

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** Protecting your capital is more important than chasing profits. Keeping drawdowns small ensures you stay in the game longer! ðŸš€

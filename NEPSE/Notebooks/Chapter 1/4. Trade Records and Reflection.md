## **Trade Rationale:** 🎯

- **SHIVM**: Expected to reach 600 due to previous resistance zone. It reached close but couldn't break 600. 💥

- **CORBL**: Anticipated a rise due to significant accumulation and strong performance in the previous bull market. However, faced strong rejection at resistance. 📉

- **TAMOR**: Expected to reach its previous high from the identified **bullish flag pattern**. It did reach the high, but I couldn't book profit at that level. ⚡

## **Trade Evaluation:** 🔍

- ✅ **Followed my trading plan** and executed entry and exit signals correctly. ✔️

- 🧠 **Managed risk** and **emotions**, but it wasn't enough. ⚖️

- 📈 Learned that **Bullish flag patterns** with **double bottoms** (TAMOR) and **Bullish Rectangles** with **trendline** (SHIVM) at important support levels with high volume breakouts are strong momentum indicators. 💪

- 💡 Could improve by using a **trailing stop-loss** to capture more profit if the trend extends further. 🔄

- 💭 **Need to improve emotional control** to avoid missing profit-taking opportunities. 😌

### 🔍 **Trade Analysis:**

The chart shows that SHIVM is in a downtrend, indicated by the lower lows (LL) and lower highs (LH). I observed a previous bullish trend on SHIVM and noticed that the market, i.e., SHIVM, was at the low of the previous downtrend, which might be a good opportunity to catch. Then I saw a bullish candle appearing but not able to push the price, indicating that there are buyers at this level. The level 380 to 420 was a consolidated level forming a bullish rectangle. Initially, my target was 480, but I trailed my stop loss and kept holding. I wanted to hold until the trend, but I couldn’t do so because I bought other stocks and had to pay for them. Finally, I sold it on **18 June 2023**.

I was successful in this trade but couldn’t extract maximum profit because I ran out of buying more stocks, which caused me to sell it before my actual plan.


- **Exit Strategy Adjustment:**  
  Initially, my target was 480. However, as the price continued to rise, I adjusted by trailing my stop loss to 580 to lock in more profit. Unfortunately, external factors caused me to sell earlier than planned, as I needed liquidity for other stock purchases. I exited on **June 18, 2023**, with a profit of **84,000**.

- **Missed Potential:**  
  Although the trade was profitable, I couldn't maximize the full potential because of the premature exit caused by liquidity needs.

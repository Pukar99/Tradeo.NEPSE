# ðŸŽ² Exercise 1: Coin Toss Experiment

## ðŸ•’ Time:  
- **Start:** 22:30  
- **End:** 22:45  

### ðŸ“‹ Objective:  
Simply toss a coin **100 times** and record the number of **Heads (H)** and **Tails (T)** in intervals of 10 tosses. Discuss the results to see if the coin follows the **Law of Large Numbers**.

---

### ðŸ§® **Results:**

| **Toss Range** | **No. of Heads (H)** | **No. of Tails (T)** |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 0 - 10         | 3                    | 7                    |
| 10 - 20        | 6                    | 4                    |
| 20 - 30        | 2                    | 8                    |
| 30 - 40        | 5                    | 5                    |
| 40 - 50        | 5                    | 5                    |
| 50 - 60        | 5                    | 5                    |
| 60 - 70        | 6                    | 4                    |
| 70 - 80        | 6                    | 4                    |
| 80 - 90        | 7                    | 3                    |
| 90 - 100       | 5                    | 5                    |

### ðŸ“Š **Summary of Results:**
- **Total Heads (H):** 50  
- **Total Tails (T):** 50  

---

### ðŸ“ˆ **Analysis:**

1. **Expected Outcome:**  
   - The expected outcome was approximately **50:50** for Heads and Tails.  

2. **Real Outcome:**  
   - The experiment resulted in a **50:50** distribution, with an equal number of Heads and Tails.

3. **Law of Large Numbers:**  
   - This experiment demonstrates the **Law of Large Numbers**, where the relative frequency of Heads and Tails approaches the theoretical probability (50%) as the number of tosses increases.

---

### âœ… **Conclusion:**  
- The coin used in this experiment appears to be **fair**, as it gave equal chances (50-50) to each toss.
- Over a large number of tosses, the results align with theoretical expectations, confirming the fairness of the coin and the **Law of Large Numbers**.

---

ðŸ’¡ **Fun Fact:**  
Did you know that even if there are small imbalances in short-term results (like 3:7 in the first 10 tosses), over time, the results balance out? This is why larger sample sizes are important for statistical experiments! ðŸŽ‰

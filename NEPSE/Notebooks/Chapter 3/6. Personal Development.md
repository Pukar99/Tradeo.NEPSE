   - **Lesson:** Small, consistent improvements (1% better every day) compound into massive success over time.  
   - **Trading Application:**  
     - Focus on improving your trading strategies or analysis skills a little each day.
     - Example: Spend 15 minutes daily reviewing past trades and journaling lessons.

   - **Lesson:** Goals are important, but systems create sustainable results. Instead of obsessing over outcomes, focus on the process.  
   - **Trading Application:**  
     - Don’t just aim for a certain profit target; build a **systematic approach** for trade entries, exits, and risk management.  
     - Example: Develop a consistent daily trading routine.

#### 3. **🧠 Identity-Based Habits**  
   - **Lesson:** To achieve lasting change, align your habits with the identity you want to build.

#### 4. **🚀 The Power of Atomic Changes**  
   - **Lesson:** Break down habits into small, manageable actions. Even tiny changes can create big momentum.  
   - **Trading Application:**

     - Build momentum by stacking habits:  
       - Example: After completing your pre-market analysis, write down your top trade setups.

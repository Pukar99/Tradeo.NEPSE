### **ðŸ“‰ Why I Cancelled My SIP**  

1. **My Confidence as a Trader:**  
   - I realized that I have developed strong trading skills and can independently buy and sell stocks.  
   - This allows me to generate better returns consistently, as long as I remain disciplined and follow my strategies.  

2. **Poor Performance of the SIP:**  
   - Over 2 years, my SIP didnâ€™t yield dividends or meaningful returns.  
   - I had invested **â‚¹55,000**, but my total profit was only **â‚¹3,000**, which wasnâ€™t worth the time or opportunity cost.  

3. **The Need for Capital:**  
   - I identified better opportunities in individual stocks but didnâ€™t have sufficient funds.  
   - To capitalize on these opportunities, I sold my SIP for **â‚¹45,500** and redirected the money into trading.

### **ðŸ’° Transition to CORBL Investment**  

#### **Step 1: Investing in CORBL**  
- With the funds from my SIP, I purchased:  
  - **110 kittas of CORBL at â‚¹412 per share**, using approximately **â‚¹45,500.**  

---

#### **Step 2: Gradual Selling and Execution Strategy**  

1. **First Partial Sale:**  
   - Sold **55 kittas at â‚¹841**, securing a significant profit.  
   - **Lesson from NFS:** I learned the importance of scaling out and not selling all shares at once. This allowed the winner to run.  

2. **Second Partial Sale:**  
   - Sold **10 kittas at â‚¹970.**  
   - I initially wanted to sell all remaining shares here, but only 10 kittas were executed, which worked in my favor.  

3. **Final Sale:**  
   - Sold the remaining **48 kittas at â‚¹1673**, closing my entire position.  
   - This marked the end of an exceptionally profitable trade.

### **ðŸ’¸ Outcome: The Power of Active Trading**  

- **Initial Investment:** â‚¹45,500 from SIP proceeds.  
- **Total Profit Before Tax:** â‚¹1,38,000.  
- **Tax Deduction:** â‚¹6,000.  
- **Net Profit:** â‚¹1,32,000.  
- **Timeframe:** Achieved these results within **5-6 months.**

### **ðŸŒŸ New Strategy Moving Forward: Investing Like SIP**  

1. **Monthly Investments:**  
   - Instead of a traditional SIP, I will invest **â‚¹5,500** every month into fundamentally strong companies starting **January 2025**.  
   - This approach combines the discipline of SIP with the flexibility of choosing good stocks based on market opportunities.  

2. **Building a Portfolio Over Time:**  
   - Each month, Iâ€™ll research and invest in companies that align with my trading rules and offer strong potential for growth.  
   - This allows me to stay consistent, manage risk, and grow my portfolio steadily.

### **ðŸŒŸ Lessons Learned from CORBL and NFS**  

1. **Let the Winner Run:**  
   - From my experience with NFS, I learned to trail stop-losses and scale out systematically. This was crucial to maximizing profits with CORBL.  

2. **Reinvest Stuck Funds Strategically:**  
   - Redirecting money from low-performing SIPs to high-potential stocks can unlock immense value if done with proper research.  

3. **Consistency Over Time:**  
   - The discipline of monthly investments (like SIP) ensures that I steadily build wealth while leveraging my trading skills.

### **ðŸ”— Connecting Back to NFS**  

- My earlier experience with **NFS** shaped my approach to scaling out of trades and adjusting stop-losses dynamically.  
- Applying these lessons with CORBL proved highly effective and reinforced the importance of disciplined execution.

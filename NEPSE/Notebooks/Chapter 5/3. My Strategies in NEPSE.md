## **📝 My Trading Strategies in NEPSE**

### **📖 Background**  
I am currently a trader in **NEPSE**. I began trading during the bearish momentum at **3200** in the index. Initially, I made several mistakes, such as trying to "catch a falling knife," fueled by the hope of a quick reversal. Over time, I learned the critical lesson: **"The trend is your friend."**  

Since NEPSE is a one-way market, trading here demands extensive research and disciplined planning before entering any sector or script.

### **🔍 How I Identify a Bullish NEPSE**  

To determine whether NEPSE is turning bullish, I use a systematic approach:  

1. **📉 Interest Rates:**  
   I analyze the base interest rate set by **Rastra Bank**. A bullish signal emerges when the interest rate starts decreasing, as it eases liquidity in the market.

2. **📜 Monetary Policies:**  
   I check if any new monetary policies are favorable for the market. Positive policy changes can trigger bullish sentiment.  

3. **🏛️ Political Analysis:**  
   Although not mandatory, I monitor political factors as they can add an edge to my probabilities. For instance, the market reacts positively to the **Nepali Communist Party** or when **Bishnu Poudel** is the Finance Minister.  

4. **📊 Transaction Volume in NEPSE:**  
   - **High Volume (>10 Arba):** Likely indicates a rally in high-cap stocks.  
   - **Low Volume (Dry Volume):** In sideways markets with low volume, there's a higher chance of momentum in low-cap stocks.

#### **🏢 How I Select the Company/Script:**  

1. **📉 Look for Divergence:**  
   I check for divergence between NEPSE and the company I'm analyzing. Divergences indicate opportunities where the stock may outperform or move independently of the index.  

2. **📈 Breakout and Sideways Movement:**  
   - I select companies that show **breakout behavior** or a **change in structure** from bearish to bullish.

3. **🔄 Retest Entry Strategy:**  
   - Once a stock breaks out of a range or trendline, I wait for a **retest** before entering the trade.  
   - I set my **stop loss** at the closing price of the previous swing low.  

4. **📊 Rules for Holding the Trade:**  
   - **Higher Highs:** The stock must form at least **two higher highs** to confirm bullish momentum.  
   - **Support and Buying Strength:** At every support level, there should be buying activity, followed by a new higher high.  
   - **Trailing Stop Loss:**  
     - I trail my stop loss to the **closing price of the new swing low** after every higher high.

   - But his **average loss is less than $1**, and his **average gain is more than $1** thanks to smart adjustments.  

2. **🛠️ Trade Grades:**  
   - **A-Quality Trades:** High-confidence trades with more risk and more opportunity to grow profits.  
   - **B-Quality Trades:** Moderate-confidence trades with simpler rules and smaller risks.  

3. **🚪 Exiting Early:**  
   - If a trade isn’t working as planned, he exits **before it hits the full loss limit (stop-loss).**

## 🔑 Risk Management Techniques  

### 1. **🚦 Exiting Early:**  
   - If the trade feels wrong or isn’t following your plan, **close it early** before it hits the full loss limit.  
   - ✅ Example: If you risk 1%, exiting early might result in a smaller loss, like 0.5% or 0.7%.  

### 2. **📈 Adding to Winners (A-Quality Only):**  
   - If a trade is going great, **add more** to it using the profits you’ve already made.  
   - 🛡️ This increases your chance of bigger gains while keeping the total risk the same.  

### 3. **🔒 Trailing Stop-Loss (A-Quality Only):**  
   - Move your stop-loss higher as the trade makes more profit.  
   - 🎯 This locks in gains and protects you from losing your profit if the market suddenly reverses.  

---

## 🤔 Why This Strategy Works (Even with a Low Win Rate)  
- **📉 Smaller Losses:** Exiting early means losses are always less than planned.  
- **📊 Bigger Gains:** Adding to winners and locking in profits makes average gains much higher.  
- **🎯 Focused Effort:** More risk on strong trades (A-quality) and less risk on average ones (B-quality) boosts overall performance.

   - If a trade feels wrong, close it fast to avoid a full loss.

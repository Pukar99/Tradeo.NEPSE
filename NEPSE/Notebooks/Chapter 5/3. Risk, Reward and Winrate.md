# ⚖️ **Risk-Reward: The Key to Consistent Profits**  

**Risk-Reward Ratio** is a fundamental concept in trading. It determines how much you stand to gain (reward) for every dollar you risk (loss). Success in trading isn’t just about having a high win rate; it’s about ensuring your wins outweigh your losses over time.

## 🔑 **What is Risk-Reward Ratio?**  

- **Risk:** The amount you’re willing to lose on a trade (e.g., $100).  
- **Reward:** The amount you aim to gain from a trade (e.g., $300).  
- **Risk-Reward Ratio Formula:**  
  \[
  \text{Risk-Reward Ratio} = \frac{\text{Potential Loss}}{\text{Potential Gain}}
  \]  

💡 **Example:**  
If you risk $100 to make $300:  
\[
\text{Risk-Reward Ratio} = \frac{100}{300} = 1:3
\]

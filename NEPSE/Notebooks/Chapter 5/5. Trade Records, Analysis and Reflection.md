### **🛠️ Trade Setup**

**✨ Why I Took This Trade:**  

1. **Bullish Higher Highs (1W & 1D)**  
   - On both weekly (1W) and daily (1D) timeframes, NFS was forming *higher highs* while **Nepse** was making equal lows and moving sideways. This was a bullish signal that caught my attention.

2. **Trendline Breakout and Strong Swings (1D)**  
   - On the daily timeframe, NFS broke its trendline and started making higher high swings. This indicated a high probability of breaking through the resistance, which aligned with my entry rules.

3. **Strong Bullish History in Prior Trends**  
   - During previous bullish runs, NFS performed exceptionally well due to its low-cap nature, making it easier for prices to rise. Based on my analysis, low-cap stocks like NFS tend to outperform in Nepse's bullish phases, especially during tops and bottoms when traders shift focus to such stocks.

### **💭 Emotional Reflection**

- **😬 During the Trade:**  
   - The frequent red candles, despite higher highs, made me feel *fearful and impatient*.  
   - Sideways movement caused confusion and anxiety. However, comparing NFS's strength to Nepse helped me stay in the trade.

- **😔 After the Trade:**  
   - I felt *happy* after booking profits 🎉, but when NFS broke past my target and continued its rally, I became *sad and regretful*.  
   - Initially, I thought the rally was a trap and hoped for a reversal, but the market moved 100% opposite to my expectations. This made me frustrated and angry.

### **⚠️ Mistakes or Deviations**

- **✅ Did I Follow My Trading Plan?**  
   - Yes, but my entry could have been earlier after the trendline breakout to achieve a better risk-reward ratio. My slight delay wasn’t critical, but timely entries are important.  

- **🔄 Errors in Execution:**  
   - Exiting the entire position was a mistake. I could’ve trailed my stop loss or used a systematic profit-booking method, such as exiting 50% at my target and letting the rest ride the uptrend.

### **🔍 Post-Trade Reflection**

- **👍 What Went Well:**  
   - The trade aligned with my strategy and technical analysis.  
   - Risk was well-managed, and I followed my plan effectively.  

- **🛠️ What Can I Improve:**  
   1. **Entry Timing:** Enter after a clear breakout to maximize the risk-reward ratio.  
   2. **Profit-Booking Strategy:** Implement a staged exit approach (e.g., 50%-50%) or use a trailing stop loss to capture more profits during strong trends.  
   3. **Emotional Control:** Accept that missing further rallies is part of trading and avoid emotional reactions.

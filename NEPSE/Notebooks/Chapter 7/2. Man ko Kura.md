## 👋 Hello,

I recently had a realization—a true "why didn’t I see this sooner?" moment.

I have a best friend who’s been close for years and is always there when I need him. However, when it comes to trading, his views are completely different. He sees the market as nothing more than gambling. Every time I talk about trading, he quickly says things like:  
- 🔹 *“People lose everything in this game.”*  
- 🔹 *“It’s all luck. No one can consistently make money.”*  
- 🔹 *“Just cash out before you lose more.”*

Adding to that, he clings to a typical Nepali, old-money mindset—firmly believing in the proverb *"हलो जोतेर मात्र धनी मान्छे बन्नुपर्छ।"* (only those who work hard become rich). He is stuck on the old rules of money and refuses to learn and adapt to new changes according to our evolving environment. Although he talks about honesty, his actions reveal an opportunistic streak, and he often claims that rich people are evil. In his narrow view, money is limited, and he believes that people can’t be good with money—a mindset that ignores how hard trading truly is. This outdated mentality is something we simply can’t afford when innovation and adaptation are critical for success.

At first, I laughed it off because he doesn’t trade—so what does he know? But gradually, his negativity began to affect me. I started hesitating, second-guessing my trades, and, worst of all, doubting myself.

Even when I had a **solid setup**, his voice echoed in my mind:  
> *"Are you sure? What if you lose again?"*  
> *"The market is rigged anyway."*  
And as a result, I missed opportunities.

Then one day, it hit me:

**Why am I letting someone who doesn’t even trade affect my mindset?**

Think about it:  
- **He doesn’t analyze charts at 2 AM.**  
- **He never researches strategies, studies market patterns, or backtests setups.**  
- **He isn’t willing to risk money, but I am.**  
- **He is fearful—I control my own risk.**  
- **He doesn’t understand market movements, trend formations, or money flows.**  
- **He works for someone else—I am my own boss.**

So, why let *his* opinions influence *my* decisions?

These types of people are all around us. They can be our best friends and excellent companions, yet their outdated thinking and narrow perspectives can slowly seep into our mindset—often without us realizing it until it’s too late. Recognizing this influence early is crucial to maintaining focus and protecting our own approach.

The irony is clear. After months of insisting that **trading is gambling**, the tables turned.

📉 **When the market started rising, he suddenly wanted to trade.**  
One day, he asked, **"Hey, I just bought NRM. Is it a good trade?"**  
But here’s the catch: **He bought NRM at the market’s top.** After buying, he immediately started predicting that NEPSE would break the resistance of 3200, overestimating the market and trying to forecast its every move. I knew it wasn’t going to end well. And indeed:

📊 **The stock remained flat for months.**  
⏳ **He waited and waited until nothing happened.**  
Then, just as the market was about to **correct**, he panicked and sold at a loss.

It gets even more ironic.

Instead of learning from his mistake, he **jumped into Bitcoin** through his brother **at $100,000**, convinced it would soon hit **$140K**.

Consider this:  
- ⚠️ **He ignored the market at its bottom.**  
- ⚠️ **He entered late when everyone else was already in.**  
- ⚠️ **He panic-sold when he should have held.**  
- ⚠️ **He blindly chased hype at the worst possible time.**

This is the **exact** behavior of the 90% of traders who fail.

That’s when I truly understood: **I don’t need to think like the top 10%—I just need to stop thinking like the 90%.**

So I made a choice. I told him, **"Listen, I respect your opinions, but I don’t want to talk about trading with you anymore."**

This wasn’t about pushing him away—he’s still my best friend. It was about **setting boundaries** and **protecting my mindset**.

And it changed everything.

Since then, I’ve felt **lighter, more focused, and more confident.** I replaced his negativity with **positive affirmations** and reminders:

- ✅ *I follow a well-defined strategy, not random impulses.*  
- ✅ *I manage my risk, so no single trade can break me.*  
- ✅ *I focus on what works, not on fears and doubts.*  
- ✅ *I don’t need to think like the top 10%—I just need to stop thinking like the 90% who fail.*  
- ✅ *I let my winners run big and cut my losers short.*  
- ✅ *Simplicity eliminates 90% of trading struggles—overcomplication is the enemy.*

This shift has been **game-changing.** I now trade with clarity and do not let outside noise shake my confidence.

## 🔄 The Lesson?

Be **mindful of who you discuss trading with.** Not everyone understands trading, and that’s okay. But if someone’s words hold you back, **set boundaries and protect your mindset.**  
Also, be careful before sharing your thoughts and always seek suggestions from experts in the field—or at least from those who have hands-on experience in that area.

Keep it simple, stay focused, and trust the process!

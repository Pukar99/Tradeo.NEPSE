## ❌ **Reasons for Failed Breakouts**

1. **🛑 False Breakout**  
   - Breakouts that initially appear promising can be false signals.

2. **⚠️ Lack of Confirmation**  
   - Breakouts should ideally be confirmed by volume or other indicators.

3. **📉 Whipsaw Price Action**  
   - Market volatility can cause whipsaw price action, where the price moves rapidly in both directions.

4. **🔒 Stop-Loss Placement**  
   - Retailers often place stop-loss orders just below the breakout point.  
   - Institutional traders may exploit these orders, triggering them before price resumes its intended direction.

5. **🎭 Market Manipulation**  
   - Large players may manipulate prices to trap retailers through artificial price moves.
